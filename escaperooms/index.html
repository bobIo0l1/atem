      <h2>Expedition: Catastrophe</h2>
      <p>An explorer's plane crashed recently. You and your friends went to explore the site. The scrap parts of the wing fell down behind you, trapping you in the debris. You discovered an oil leak and estimated an hour to escape. With the exits blocked and time ticking, you must dig through the explorer's journals and maps to figure out where the emergency exit is.</p><br>

      <h2>In the Belly of the Bronze Beast</h2>
      <p>You took a job as the operator of a new machine. The purpose of the machine, though, remained unknown.. A week after you were hired, the machine breaks down, causing all of the exits to shut. There is another exit, but it locked and is opened by a code only your boss knows. Luckily, he isn't very organized, meaning he has left clues all around the operating room that help to solve the code. Will you crack the code before you overheat?</p><br>

      <h2>House of the Occult</h2>
      <p>A fun prank has gone wrong. Your best friend, George, tried to pull a practical joke involving a haunted house. He invited you and his other friends, but when you got there, only a pile of blood and bones were all that was left of George.

Hoping to save yourselves, you and a few of your neighbors hid in a quarantine vault with only a few basic supplies and a computer. After 12 years, you revieced a message. The plague has been eradicated. Excited, you try to open the door only to find the door mechanism has malfunctioned. You remember the override mechanism, and dash to it. After so long, you don't remember how to use the opening command. You and your peers must put their brains to the test to find out how to open the door. Oh, and one more thing: you have run out of food.</p><br>

      <h2>Illusory</h2>
      <p>Hello my esteemed friend! It is Karl. If you are recieving this letter, I have kicked the bucket. I have dedicated $100,000 dollars to each of my friends in an act of pure charity. There is a catch, however. To recieve this money, you must complete a series of puzzles located in my mansion. I would suggest working together with the others, as the puzzles require more than one person to solve. Good luck and farewell!</p><br>
