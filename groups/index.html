  <p>Escape room puzzles are great at challenging the mind and are also excellent at challenging teamwork ability. Doing an escape room as a group is one of the most fun things to do, as well as one of the most rewarding. Whether you are a business, school, family, or anything else, Dilemma welcomes groups.</p>
  <h2>How Esacpe rooms help improve team work:</h2>
  <p>Teamwork is at the heart of an escape room. Without temwork, an escape room will be very difficult. Teamwork can even be telling someone you are working with that you solved something. Our escape rooms bring out the teamwork to help your company with making your team better.</p>
  <h2>Planning group events:</h2>
  <p>There is a maximum of 12 people. If your company/school would like to have more than 12 people at our escape room, we will have to do them seperatley.</p>
